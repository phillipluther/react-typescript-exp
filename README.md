# Experimenting w/ React and Typescript

Personal growth project to get slightly more TS-savvy. Following along with [this Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2JCjVSZlG0) vid on YouTube.

Bit of extra learning since the thing uses Styled Components. Bully!

Thanks to the [Open Triva API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) called out in that YouTube video, as well. They're still up as of whatever the last commit date is.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using its Typescript template (`--template typescript`). If anything looks odd with the setup, blame that crew.
